# A notes app for Amity 

We didn't have a centralised notes application for our college and we had to rely on google drive folders for retreiving the notes

## TODO

- [ ] Make a reward system for uploading notes
- [ ] Implement an AI to automatically scan and refine the notes as soon as they are uploaded
- [ ] Do something for API safety so only authorized clients can use your API
- [ ] Add zod schema validation to your backend/frontend
